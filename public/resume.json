    "objective": "Imagine a world where software anticipates your needs, learns from you, and evolves alongside you—that’s the future I’m building toward. Curiosity is my compass: I explore the boundary between human intelligence and machine “smarts” by dissecting the why behind human decision-making and shaping AI/ML models that learn to think in their own way. As an AI/ML-focused engineer, I bridge human intuition and machine precision, shipping intelligent web applications that make life smoother and more surprising. By day I’m integrating LLMs into natural-language scheduling assistants; by night I’m cooking at high heat, tackling chess and Catan puzzles at the board-game table, or laying down bass and sax riffs. I’m excited to bring this blend of curiosity, creativity, and code to a team tackling real-world challenges—and if you’re as eager as I am to build tech that’s intuitive, inclusive, and just a little bit magical, let’s chat!",

            "longDescription": "Inclusive communication means merging vision and voice - and that's exactly what this in-progress platform does. An OpenCV pipeline captures hand gestures at 30 FPS with 95% recognition accuracy, while a speech-to-text + LLM stack (via LangChain4j) delivers translations into five target languages in under three seconds. Built with modular APIs and accessibility first, it's designed to scale to new symbol sets, dialects, and 100 requests/min throughput for truly global, multi-modal conversations."
